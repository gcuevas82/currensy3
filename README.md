This project was created using HTML, CSS, React and the currency API https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest. The color palette for the bars remained the same as in the first currensy repo. 
The bars were coded to display the 4 highest value world currencies with a default base of USD. The drop down bar allows the user to choose a currency base and the bars will then change to display the rates based on the base that has been chosen. 
The repo was named after Curren$y. 
Most of the CSS remained the same with the exception of the bar-graph-axis.
